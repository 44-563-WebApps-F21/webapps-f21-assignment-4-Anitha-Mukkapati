    <h3>A Woman of no Importance</h3>

    <h4>Act 1 - The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase </h4>

    MRS. ALLONBY. But somehow, I feel sure that if I lived in the country
    for six months, I should become so unsophisticated that no one would take
    the slightest notice of me.

    LADY HUNSTANTON. I assure you, dear, that the country has not that
    effect at all. Why, it was from Melthorpe, which is only two miles from
    here, that Lady Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale. I remember the
    occurrence perfectly. Poor Lord Belton died three days afterwards of
    joy, or gout. I forget which. We had a large party staying here at the
    time, so we were all very much interested in the whole affair.

    MRS. ALLONBY. I think to elope is cowardly. It’s running away from
    danger. And danger has become so rare in modern life.

    LADY CAROLINE. As far as I can make out, the young women of the present
    day seem to make it the sole object of their lives to be always playing
    with fire.

    MRS. ALLONBY. The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady Caroline, is
    that one never gets even singed. It is the people who don’t know how to
    play with it who get burned up.

    LADY STUTFIELD. Yes; I see that. It is very, very helpful.

    LADY HUNSTANTON. I don’t know how the world would get on with such a
    theory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby.

    LADY STUTFIELD. Ah! The world was made for men and not for women.

    MRS. ALLONBY. Oh, don’t say that, Lady Stutfield. We have a much better
    time than they have. There are far more things forbidden to us than are
    forbidden to them.

    LADY STUTFIELD. Yes; that is quite, quite true. I had not thought of
    that.

    [_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ MR. KELVIL.]

    LADY HUNSTANTON. Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your work?

    KELVIL. I have finished my writing for the day, Lady Hunstanton. It has
    been an arduous task. The demands on the time of a public man are very
    heavy nowadays, very heavy indeed. And I don’t think they meet with
    adequate recognition.

    LADY CAROLINE. John, have you got your overshoes on?

    SIR JOHN. Yes, my love.

    LADY CAROLINE. I think you had better come over here, John. It is more
    sheltered.

    SIR JOHN. I am quite comfortable, Caroline.

    LADY CAROLINE. I think not, John. You had better sit beside me. [SIR
    JOHN _rises and goes across_.]

    LADY STUTFIELD. And what have you been writing about this morning, Mr.
    Kelvil?

    KELVIL. On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield. On Purity.

    LADY STUTFIELD. That must be such a very, very interesting thing to
    write about.
